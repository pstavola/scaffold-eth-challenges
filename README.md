# Challenge 4 of [SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-challenges/tree/challenge-4-dex)

## Minimum Viable Exchange

This challenge consists in building a simple decentralized exchange with just one token-pair: BALLOONS ($BAL) and ETH.  
  
Solidity side I implemented all the functions required by an exchange including price function and swap tokens functions.  
UI side I added approve() events to be displayed.  
  
The final deliverable is a smart contract that you can use to swap tokens in a caompletely trustless manner.
